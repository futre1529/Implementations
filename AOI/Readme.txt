AOI - A data generalization algorithm to replace relatively low-level
attribut values with higher-level concepts. Allows data to be 
generalized at multiple levels of abstraction.

Aggregation is performed by merging identical generalized tuples and accumulating
their respective counts. This reduces the size of the generalized data set. The resulting
generalized relation can be mapped into different forms for presentation to the user.

Sample Input - "AOIfile.txt"

Sample Output (Generalized data) -

"Gender" "Major" "Birth-country" "Age-range" "Gpa-classification" 

25 such entries after Generalization
(Discrete attributes "Name" and "Ph_No." have been removed by generalization".
